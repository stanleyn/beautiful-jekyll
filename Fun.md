#subtitle: Why you'd want to go on a date with me

I am grateful to live in North Carolina where the nature is gorgeous and the weather is (for the most part) beautiful. I spend my free time running, hiking, and practicing yoga. Occassionally, I like to climb but I am often worried about breaking my ankle, which would prevent me from running. :) I also like to cook vegan food and voluteer with rescue dogs.
