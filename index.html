Hello and thanks for visiting my webpage. I am a 5th year PhD student in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at The University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, where I am fortunate to work with <a href="https://mucha.web.unc.edu">Professor Peter Mucha</a>. My research is primarily focused on the adaptation of community detection to handle more challenging types of network data, such as, situations where networks are large, attributed, and multilayer. I enjoy applying the methods I develop to problems in computational biology and particuarly have worked with microbiome, metabolomic, genomic, and neuroscience data.

Soon, I will move to Stanford to join the <a href="https://nalab.stanford.edu">Aghaeepour Lab</a>, where I will transition my research focus to computational immunology. \\
