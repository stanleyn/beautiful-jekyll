Hello. I am a postdoc at Stanford working in computational and systems immunology with <a href="https://nalab.stanford.edu"> Prof. Nima Aghaeepour</a>. My research is broadly focused on <b> 1) mass cytometry bioinformatics 2) single-cell analysis 3) computational immunology and 4) graph algorithms. </b> Mass cytometry is an amazing single-cell technology that enables the simultaneous measurement of >45 proteins at a single-cell level. As a postdoc, I have focused on how to relate single-cell mass cytometry data to external variables of interest (such as clinical outcome). This is a challenging problem given the heterogenity and diverse amount of information contained across the hundreds of millions of cells in an individual single-cell experiment. Prior to joining Stanford, I finished my PhD at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with <a href="https://mucha.web.unc.edu"> Prof. Peter Mucha</a>. My graduate research was focused on graph algorithms and in particular, community detection. I love collaborating with people with complementary skillsets and I always enjoy the opportunity to learn immunology and cell biology.  

<p>
<b>News: I am very happy to say that I am joining <a href="https://cs.unc.edu/"> UNC Computer Science</a> and <a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/compmed/"> UNC Computational Medicine</a> as an Assistant Professor! I will be looking for  students to work on mass cytometry bioinformatics, computational immunology, single cell analysis, and of course, a healthy dose of graph partitioning! </b>
