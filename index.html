Hello. I am a postdoc at Stanford working in computational and systems immunology with <a href="https://nalab.stanford.edu"> Prof. Nima Aghaeepour</a>. My current research interests are in flow/mass cytometry bioinformatics and developing novel machine learning approaches for integrating multiomics datasets. I particularly like working with CyTOF data and its ability to reveal a holistic view of the immune system and its predictive power in clinical studies. I am new to immunology, but feel like I have found my second passion (after machine learning :)) in life. This is a rich area of biology that is not well understood. Prior to joining Stanford, I finished my PhD in computational biology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with <a href="https://mucha.web.unc.edu"> Dr. Peter Mucha</a>. My graduate research was focused on developing and extending community detection approaches in networks. I focused on methods to accomodate more complex types of network structures, such as those that are multilayer (e.g. multiple relational definitions) and large. During this time I also fell in love with North Carolina and found my home in the world. :)
