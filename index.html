Hello. I am a postdoc at Stanford working on computational immunology with <a href="https://nalab.stanford.edu">Professor Nima Aghaeepour</a>. I am interested in CyTOF data and how computational tools and machine learning techniques can be applied to understand human immunology. Prior to Stanford. I finished my PhD in computational biology at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, with <a href="https://mucha.web.unc.edu">Professor Peter Mucha</a>. During this time, I focused on developing and extending community detection tools for the analysis of network data.
