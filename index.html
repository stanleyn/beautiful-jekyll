Hello and thanks for visiting my webpage. I am a 5th year PhD student in Bioinformatics and Computationa Biology at The University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, where I am fortunate to work with Professor Peter Mucha. My research is primarily focused on the adaptation of community detection to handle more challenging types of network data, such as, situations where networks are large, attributed, and multilayer. I enjoy applying the methods I develop to problems in computational biology and particuarly have worked with microbiome, metabolomic, genomic, and neuroscience data.

Soon, I will move to Stanford to join the Aghaeepour Lab, where I will transition my research focus to computational immunology.
