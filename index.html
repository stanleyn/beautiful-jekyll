Hello. I am a postdoc at Stanford working in computational and systems immunology with <a href="https://nalab.stanford.edu"> Prof. Nima Aghaeepour</a>. My current research interests are in mass cytometry bioinformatics and developing novel machine learning techniques for integrating data across multiple biological modalities (e.g. multiomics). I particularly like working with CyTOF data for its ability to reveal a holistic view of the immune system, along with its predictive power in clinical studies. Prior to joining Stanford, I finished my PhD at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with <a href="https://mucha.web.unc.edu"> Prof. Peter Mucha</a>. My graduate research was focused on developing and extending community detection methods in networks. I focused on methods to accomodate more complex types of network structures, such as those that are multilayer (e.g. multiple relational definitions) and large. 

I am driven by learning immunology and collaborating with people who have complementary skill sets. I also love to talk about graph Laplacians ;).
