Hello and thanks for visiting my webpage. I recently earned my PhD in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology with <a href="https://mucha.web.unc.edu">Professor Peter Mucha</a> at The University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. My research focus during my PhD was on community detection in networks. In particular, I addressed some limitations of community detection methods in more challenging types of network data (multilayer, attributed, and large). 

I am excited to move to Stanford to start my postdoc with <a href="https://nalab.stanford.edu">Professor Nima Aghaeepour</a>. I look forward to beginning life as a computational immunologist. I will use machine learning techniques to better understand CyTOF and other types of 'omics data in the context of human immunology.
