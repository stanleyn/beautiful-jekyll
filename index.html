I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://cs.unc.edu/"> Department of Computer Science</a> and <a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/compmed/">Computational Medicine Program</a> at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and lead the <a href="https://compcylab.squarespace.com/"> CompCy Lab</a>. My research is broadly focused on <b> 1) single-cell bioinformatics 2) computational and systems immunology, and 3) developing algorithms for representing and understanding graph-based data (many of these concepts are very appropriate for studying single-cell data!)</b>. As a postdoc, I particularly focused on how to relate single-cell mass cytometry data to external variables of interest (such as clinical outcome). This is a challenging problem, given the heterogenity and diverse amount of information contained across the hundreds of millions of cells collected in an individual single-cell experiment.</p>

<p>I completed training as a postdoc in computational and systems immunology at Stanford with <a href="https://nalab.stanford.edu"> Nima Aghaeepour</a> from 2018-2020. Prior to joining Stanford, I finished my PhD in 2018 with <a href="https://mucha.web.unc.edu"> Peter Mucha</a>, where my research focused on graph partitioning.</p>

<b> I am looking for students to work with me! If you are interested in single-cell bioinformatics, integrating multiple experimental modalities, analysis of graph-based data, systems immunology, and their intersection, please feel free to send me an email. Computational biology is a highly interdsciplinary field. Complementary perspectives and training backgrounds lead to exciting method developments and new questions. So, I am excited to welcome students from diverse backgrounds.
