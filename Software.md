1. sMLSBM. This is for fitting the Strata Multilayer Stochastic Block Model to a multilayer network. For a set of networks, this method jointly learns the cluster assignments of network layers and the stochastic block model describing each set of layers. <a href="https://https://github.com/stanleyn/sMLSBM">Code on Github</a>

2. SuperNode. Preprocess your network before community detection into a smaller network of super nodes. <a href="https://https://github.com/stanleyn/SuperNode">Code on Github</a>

3. Attributed SBM. A modification to the classic stochastic block model to take into account both connectivity and multiple continuous atrributes into account during inference. <a href="https://https://github.com/stanleyn/AttributedSBM">Code on Github</a>
