1. **VoPo**: Scalable automated cell-population discovery, classification, and visualization for single cell data. [Nature Communications][<a href="https://github.com/stanleyn/VoPo">Code on Github</a>] [<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17569-8"> Paper (Nature Communications)</a>]

2. **sMLSBM**. This is for fitting the Strata Multilayer Stochastic Block Model to a multilayer network. Given a collection of networks, this method learns multiple stochastic block models that describe each similar set of networks.

3. **SuperNode**. Preprocess your network before community detection into a smaller network of super nodes. [<a href="https://github.com/stanleyn/SuperNode">Code on Github</a>] [<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-29174-3">Paper</a>]

4. **Attributed SBM**. A modification to the classic stochastic block model to take into account both connectivity and multiple continuous atrributes node attributes in learning the parameters of a stochastic block model. [<a href="https://github.com/stanleyn/AttributedSBM">Code on Github</a>] [<a href="https://appliednetsci.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s41109-019-0170-z">Paper</a>]
