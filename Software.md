1. sMLSBM. This is for fitting the Strata Multilayer Stochastic Block Model to a multilayer network. Given a collection of networks, this method learns multiple stochastic block models that describe each similar set of networks. [<a href="https://github.com/stanleyn/sMLSBM">Code on Github</a>]

2. SuperNode. Preprocess your network before community detection into a smaller network of super nodes. [<a href="https://github.com/stanleyn/SuperNode">Code on Github</a>]

3. Attributed SBM. A modification to the classic stochastic block model to take into account both connectivity and multiple continuous atrributes node attributes in learning the parameters of a stochastic block model. [<a href="https://github.com/stanleyn/AttributedSBM">Code on Github</a>]
