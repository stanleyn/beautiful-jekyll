We are a brand new lab at UNC. Right now, we are just getting set up (and working on a lab website!) in <a href="https://cs.unc.edu/"> UNC Computer Science</a> and <a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/compmed/"> UNC Comp Med</a>. We are looking for creative PhD students to join us. Please reach out to Natalie if you think you are a good fit. 

Here is some information about us,

* We are jont between the Department of Computer Science and the Computational Medicine Program at UNC
* The main focus of our work is in developing methods to extract information from single cells profiled with technologies, such as, flow and mass cytometry. 
* We love immunology and understanding how the immune system works in particular diseases or traumas
* We are also broadly intersted in 'multimodal' or multiomics data integration. 
* We really enjoy numerical linear algebra and tackling our problems with graph-based techniques. 
* Our objective is to create open source software to accompany our publications for other peole to use on their own data. 
* We like to write code in Python, R, and Julia, and realize each language has certain strengths for particular tasks. 
* We are very excited about interdiscplinary work and the opportunity to collaborate with people in the medical school!
* We are excited to hear your ideas and unique perspectives.

Here are some potential 'about you' characteristics.

* Curoisity about biology and willingness to learn relevant biological background
* Strong coding skills, and patience and persistence with debugging
* Enjoyment of fascination with, or willingness to learn numerical linear algebra
