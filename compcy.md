We are a brand new lab. Right now, we are just getting set up (and working on a lab website!) in <a href="https://cs.unc.edu/"> UNC Computer Science</a> and <a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/compmed/"> UNC Comp Med</a>. We are looking for creative PhD students to join us. Please reach out to Natalie if you think you are a good fit. Here are some potential 'about you' characteristics.
